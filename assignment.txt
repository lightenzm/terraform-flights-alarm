Fork and clone this repository, Follow the instructions below and complete the missing parts.

Deploy each resource at a time, by performing “terraform apply” to the “modules/main.tf” file.  
Note that:
 You might need to add data-sources, terraform-settings, variables, tfvars, etc.. along the way.
 Everything that can be stored in a Variable, must be in a Variable and not be written  
 hard-coded.

1. Configure S3 backend for the modules/main.tf file
2. Complete the security-group(aws_security_group) for your application:
    a. The security-group should be connected to your VPC
    b. The security-group should allow incoming traffic from everywhere to your application port.  
3. Complete the data-source cloudconfig template-file variables.
4. Complete the aws_launch_configuration source:
    a. The argument-reference ‘key_name’ should be the name of your key-pair
5.  Create a security-group for an ELB 
    a. The security-group should be connected to your VPC.
    b. The security-group should allow incoming traffic from port 80
    c. The security-group should allow any outgoing traffic from the instance.
6. Create an ELB:
    a. The ELB port should be 8080
    a. The ELB should be created with the ELB security-group
    b. The ELB should be created with a security
7. Modify the relevent component to allow access to your application from the ELB only
8. Create a security-group for the RDS database
9. Create an RDS database 
10. Create an S3 bucket (where you will deploy your compressed application later)
